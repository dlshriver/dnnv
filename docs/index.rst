DNNV
====

DNNV is a framework for verifying deep neural networks (DNN).
DNN verification takes in a neural network, and a property over
that network, and checks whether the property is true or false.
One common DNN property is local robustness, which specifies that
inputs near a given input, will be classified similarly to that
given input.

DNNV standardizes the network and property input formats to enable
multiple verification tools to run on a single network and property.
This facilitates both verifier comparison, and artifact re-use.
