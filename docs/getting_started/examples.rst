Examples
========

We provide several example networks and properties
in an external archive,
`available here <http://cs.virginia.edu/~dls2fc/eran_benchmark.tar.gz>`_.
These networks and properties are from the benchmark of the `ERAN`_ verifier,
and are converted to the ONNX and property DSL formats required by DNNV.
