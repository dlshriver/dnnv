## How to Contribute

### Report a Bug

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/dlshriver/dnnv/issues).

Be sure to include a **title** and **clear description** with as much relevant information as possible, as well as a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the issue.

### Submit a Patch

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
